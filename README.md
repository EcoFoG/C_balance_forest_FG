# C_balance_forest_FG
This repository presents a temporally-explicit and territory scale model of carbon balance of the wood sector in a tropical territory. 
It allows modeling past carbon fluxes on the basis of logging data (area logged, logging intensity) and simulating the carbon balance of prospective scenarii of development of the timber production sector.
It was calibrated with long-term local data using Bayesian inference. 
The model accounts for carbon fluxes from selective logging in natural forest, timber plantation, first transformation and avoided emissions through energy substitution. 
All input data and parameters apply to the case of French Guiana, but the model can easily be adapted to other contexts.
