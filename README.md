# C_balance_forest_FG
This repository presents a dynamic model of carbon balance for the timber production sector of French Guiana. 
It allow modeling past carbon fluxes on the basis of logging data (area logged, logging intensity) and simulating the carbon balance of prospective scenarii of development of the timber production sector.

Codes and model description will be available soon. Meanwhile, please contact us.
